        <p>Welcome! My name is Sarah Pickering and 
        I am a software engineer based in Surprise, AZ. 
        I'm a nerdy mom and real estate agent who has a 
        passion for helping others, problem solving, 
        and creating. Outside of work, I love spending time 
        with my husband and two kids (Madelyn and Maximus). 
        I love reading, and if I have a book in front of me, 
        it's probably a thriller or mystery. When I'm not working,
        with my family, or reading, I spend my time at the gym. </p>
